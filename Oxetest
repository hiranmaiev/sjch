To capture a specific part of the screen as an image using the `RPA.Desktop` library and then perform OCR on that image, you can use the `Screenshot` keyword to take a screenshot of the desired area. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Capture a Specific Part of the Screen

The `RPA.Desktop` library allows you to capture a specific part of the screen by defining a region with coordinates (left, top, width, height). 

Here's an example test case:

```robot
*** Settings ***
Library    RPA.Desktop
Library    RPA.FileSystem

*** Test Cases ***
Capture Part of Screen and Perform OCR
    [Documentation]    Capture a specific part of the screen and perform OCR to recognize both numbers and characters.
    
    # Define the region you want to capture (left, top, width, height)
    ${left}    Set Variable    100
    ${top}     Set Variable    200
    ${width}   Set Variable    300
    ${height}  Set Variable    100
    
    # Capture the specified part of the screen
    ${image_path}    Capture Region    ${left}    ${top}    ${width}    ${height}
    
    # Set custom Tesseract configurations
    ${config}        Set Variable    --psm 6 -c tessedit_char_whitelist=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    
    # Perform OCR on the captured image
    ${text}    ${confidence}    OCR    ${image_path}    config=${config}
    
    # Log the recognized text
    Log    ${text}
    
    # Optionally, remove the image after processing
    Remove File    ${image_path}

*** Keywords ***
Capture Region
    [Arguments]    ${left}    ${top}    ${width}    ${height}
    ${image_path}    Take Screenshot    region=${left},${top},${width},${height}
    [Return]    ${image_path}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Region Definition:** 
    - `left`, `top`: The starting coordinates (in pixels) for the top-left corner of the region you want to capture.
    - `width`, `height`: The width and height of the region in pixels.

2. **Take Screenshot:**
    - `Take Screenshot` captures the specified region and saves it as an image file. The file path is returned and stored in `${image_path}`.

3. **Perform OCR:** 
    - The captured image is passed to the `OCR` keyword along with the custom Tesseract configurations (such as character whitelist). This processes the image to recognize both numbers and characters.

4. **Remove File:** 
    - Optionally, you can remove the image file after OCR processing to clean up.

### Step 2: Run the Test

You can run the test case with the following command:

```bash
robot path_to_your_test_file.robot
```

### Summary

This test case allows you to capture a specific part of the screen, save it as an image, and then perform OCR on that image using `RPA.Desktop`. The captured image is processed with custom Tesseract configurations to recognize both numbers and characters.
